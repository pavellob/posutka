# Hive Logger

Lightweight and customizable logging utility designed for use within the GraphQL Hive ecosystem. It provides structured logging capabilities, making it easier to debug and monitor applications effectively.

## Compatibility

The Hive Logger is designed to work seamlessly in all JavaScript environments, including Node.js, browsers, and serverless platforms. Its lightweight design ensures minimal overhead, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

# Getting Started

## Install

```sh
npm i @graphql-hive/logger
```

## Basic Usage

Create a default logger that set to the `info` log level writing to the console.

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger();

log.debug('I wont be logged by default');

log.info({ some: 'attributes' }, 'Hello %s!', 'world');

const child = log.child({ requestId: '123-456' });

child.warn({ more: 'attributes' }, 'Oh hello child!');

const err = new Error('Woah!');

child.error({ err }, 'Something went wrong!');
```

Will produce the following output to the console output:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Hello world!
  some: "attributes"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z WRN Oh hello child!
  requestId: "123-456"
  more: "attributes"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z ERR Something went wrong!
  requestId: "123-456"
  err: {
    stack: "Error: Woah!
        at <anonymous> (/project/example.js:13:13)
        at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:274:25)
        at async onImport.tracePromise.__proto__ (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:644:26)
        at async asyncRunEntryPointWithESMLoader (node:internal/modules/run_main:98:5)"
    message: "Woah!"
    name: "Error"
    class: "Error"
  }
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

or if you wish to have JSON output, set the `LOG_JSON` environment variable to a truthy value:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
$ LOG_JSON=1 node example.js

{"some":"attributes","level":"info","msg":"Hello world!","timestamp":"2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z"}
{"requestId":"123-456","more":"attributes","level":"info","msg":"Hello child!","timestamp":"2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z"}
{"requestId":"123-456","err":{"stack":"Error: Woah!\n    at <anonymous> (/project/example.js:13:13)\n    at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:274:25)\n    at async onImport.tracePromise.__proto__ (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:644:26)\n    at async asyncRunEntryPointWithESMLoader (node:internal/modules/run_main:98:5)","message":"Woah!","name":"Error","class":"Error"},"level":"error","msg":"Something went wrong!","timestamp":"2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z"}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Logging Methods and Their Arguments

Hive Logger provides convenient methods for each log level: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.

All logging methods support flexible argument patterns for structured and formatted logging:

### No Arguments

Logs an empty message at the specified level.

```ts
log.debug();
```

```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z DBG
```

### Attributes Only

Logs structured attributes without a message.

```ts
log.info({ hello: 'world' });
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF
  hello: "world"
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Message with Interpolation

Logs a formatted message, similar to printf-style formatting. Read more about it in the [Message Formatting section](#message-formatting).

```ts
log.warn('Hello %s!', 'World');
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z WRN Hello World!
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Attributes and Message (with interpolation)

Logs structured attributes and a formatted message. The attributes can be anything object-like, including classes.

```ts
const err = new Error('Something went wrong!');
log.error(err, 'Problem occurred at %s', new Date());
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z ERR Problem occurred at Thu Apr 10 2025 14:00:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)
  stack: "Error: Something went wrong!
      at <anonymous> (/projects/example.js:2:1)"
  message: "Something went wrong!"
  name: "Error"
  class: "Error"
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Message Formatting

The Hive Logger uses the [`quick-format-unescaped` library](https://github.com/pinojs/quick-format-unescaped) to format log messages that include interpolation (e.g., placeholders like %s, %d, etc.).

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger();

log.info('hello %s %j %d %o', 'world', { obj: true }, 4, { another: 'obj' });
```

Outputs:

```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF hello world {"obj":true} 4 {"another":"obj"}
```

Available interpolation placeholders are:

- `%s` - string
- `%d` and `%f` - number with(out) decimals
- `%i` - integer number
- `%o`,`%O` and `%j` - JSON stringified object
- `%%` - escaped percentage sign

## Logging Levels

The default logger uses the `info` log level which will make sure to log only `info`+ logs. Available log levels are:

- false (disables logging altogether)
- `trace`
- `debug`
- `info` _default_
- `warn`
- `error`

### Lazy Arguments and Performance

Hive Logger supports "lazy" attributes for log methods. If you pass a function as the attributes argument, it will only be evaluated if the log level is enabled and the log will actually be written. This avoids unnecessary computation for expensive attributes when the log would be ignored due to the current log level.

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger({ level: 'info' });

log.debug(
  // This function will NOT be called, since 'debug' is below the current log level.
  () => ({ expensive: computeExpensiveValue() }),
  'This will not be logged',
);

log.info(
  // This function WILL be called, since 'info' log level is set.
  () => ({ expensive: computeExpensiveValue() }),
  'This will be logged',
);
```

### Change Logging Level on Creation

When creating an instance of the logger, you can configure the logging level by configuring the `level` option. Like this:

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger({ level: 'debug' });

log.trace(
  // you can suply "lazy" attributes which wont be evaluated unless the log level allows logging
  () => ({
    wont: 'be evaluated',
    some: expensiveOperation(),
  }),
  'Wont be logged and attributes wont be evaluated',
);

log.debug('Hello world!');

const child = log.child('[prefix] ');

child.debug('Child loggers inherit the parent log level');
```

Outputs the following to the console:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z DBG Hello world!
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z DBG [prefix] Child loggers inherit the parent log level
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Change Logging Level Dynamically

Alternatively, you can change the logging level dynamically during runtime. There's two possible ways of doing that.

#### Using `log.setLevel(level: LogLevel)`

One way of doing it is by using the log's `setLevel` method.

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger({ level: 'debug' });

log.debug('Hello world!');

const child = log.child('[prefix] ');

child.debug('Child loggers inherit the parent log level');

log.setLevel('trace');

log.trace(() => ({ hi: 'there' }), 'Now tracing is logged too!');

child.trace('Also on the child logger');

child.setLevel('info');

log.trace('Still logging!');

child.debug('Wont be logged because the child has a different log level now');

child.info('Hello child!');
```

Outputs the following to the console:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z DBG Hello world!
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z DBG [prefix] Child loggers inherit the parent log level
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z TRC Now tracing is logged too!
  hi: "there"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z TRC [prefix] Also on the child logger
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z TRC Still logging!
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Hello child!
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Using `LoggerOptions.level` Function

Another way of doing it is to pass a function to the `level` option when creating a logger.

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

let isDebug = false;

const log = new Logger({
  level: () => {
    if (isDebug) {
      return 'debug';
    }
    return 'info';
  },
});

log.debug('isDebug is false, so this wont be logged');

log.info('Hello world!');

const child = log.child('[scoped] ');

child.debug(
  'Child loggers inherit the parent log level function, so this wont be logged either',
);

// enable debug mode
isDebug = true;

child.debug('Now debug is enabled and logged');
```

Outputs the following:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Hello world!
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z DBG [scoped] Now debug is enabled and logged
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Child Loggers

Child loggers in Hive Logger allow you to create new logger instances that inherit configuration (such as log level, writers, and attributes) from their parent logger. This is useful for associating contextual information (like request IDs or component names) with all logs from a specific part of your application.

When you create a child logger using the child method, you can:

- Add a prefix to all log messages from the child logger.
- Add attributes that will be included in every log entry from the child logger.
- Inherit the log level and writers from the parent logger, unless explicitly changed on the child.

This makes it easy to organize and structure logs in complex applications, ensuring that related logs carry consistent context.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In a child logger, attributes provided in individual log calls will overwrite any attributes inherited from the parent logger if they share the same keys. This allows you to override or add context-specific attributes for each log entry.

For example, running this:

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger();

const child = log.child({ requestId: '123-456' }, '[child] ');

child.info('Hello World!');
child.info({ requestId: 'overwritten attribute' });

const nestedChild = child.child({ traceId: '789-012' }, '[nestedChild] ');

nestedChild.info('Hello Deep Down!');
```

Will output:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF [child] Hello World!
  requestId: "123-456"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF [child]
  requestId: "overwritten attribute"
2025-04-20T18:39:30.291Z INF [child] [nestedChild] Hello Deep Down!
  requestId: "123-456"
  traceId: "789-012"
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Writers

Logger writers are responsible for handling how and where log messages are output. In Hive Logger, writers are pluggable components that receive structured log data and determine its final destination and format. This allows you to easily customize logging behavior, such as printing logs to the console, writing them as JSON, storing them in memory for testing, or sending them to external systems.

By default, Hive Logger provides several built-in writers, but you can also implement your own to suit your application's needs. The built-ins are:

### `MemoryLogWriter`

Writes the logs to memory allowing you to access the logs. Mostly useful for testing.

```ts
import { Logger, MemoryLogWriter } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const writer = new MemoryLogWriter();

const log = new Logger({ writers: [writer] });

log.info({ my: 'attrs' }, 'Hello World!');

console.log(writer.logs);
```

Outputs:

```sh
[ { level: 'info', msg: 'Hello World!', attrs: { my: 'attrs' } } ]
```

### `ConsoleLogWriter` (default)

The default log writer used by the Hive Logger. It outputs log messages to the console in a human-friendly, colorized format, making it easy to distinguish log levels and read structured attributes. Each log entry includes a timestamp, the log level (with color), the message, and any additional attributes (with colored keys), which are pretty-printed and formatted for clarity.

The writer works in both Node.js and browser-like environments, automatically disabling colors if not supported. This makes `ConsoleLogWriter` ideal for all cases, providing clear and readable logs out of the box.

```ts
import { ConsoleLogWriter, Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const writer = new ConsoleLogWriter({
  noColor: true, // defaults to env.NO_COLOR. read more: https://no-color.org/
  noTimestamp: true,
});

const log = new Logger({ writers: [writer] });

log.info({ my: 'attrs' }, 'Hello World!');
```

Outputs:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
INF Hello World!
  my: "attrs"
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### `JSONLogWriter`

> [!NOTE]
> Will be used then the `LOG_JSON=1` environment variable is provided.

Built-in log writer that outputs each log entry as a structured JSON object. When used, it prints logs to the console in JSON format, including all provided attributes, the log level, message, and a timestamp.

In the JSONLogWriter implementation, any attributes you provide with the keys `msg`, `timestamp`, or `level` will be overwritten in the final log output. This is because the writer explicitly sets these fields when constructing the log object. If you include these keys in your attributes, their values will be replaced by the logger's own values in the JSON output.

If the `LOG_JSON_PRETTY=1` environment variable is provided, the output will be pretty-printed for readability; otherwise, it is compact.

This writer's format is ideal for machine parsing, log aggregation, or integrating with external logging systems, especially useful for production environments or when logs need to be consumed by other tools.

```ts
import { JSONLogWriter, Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger({ writers: [new JSONLogWriter()] });

log.info({ my: 'attrs' }, 'Hello World!');
```

Outputs:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
{"my":"attrs","level":"info","msg":"Hello World!","timestamp":"2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z"}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Or pretty printed:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
$ LOG_JSON_PRETTY=1 node example.js

{
  "my": "attrs",
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "Hello World!",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Optional Writers

Hive Logger includes some writers for common loggers of the JavaScript ecosystem with optional peer dependencies.

#### `PinoLogWriter`

Use the [Node.js `pino` logger library](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for writing Hive Logger's logs.

`pino` is an optional peer dependency, so you must install it first.

```sh
npm i pino pino-pretty
```

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';
import { PinoLogWriter } from '@graphql-hive/logger/writers/pino';
import pino from 'pino';

const pinoLogger = pino({
  transport: {
    target: 'pino-pretty',
  },
});

const log = new Logger({ writers: [new PinoLogWriter(pinoLogger)] });

log.info({ some: 'attributes' }, 'hello world');
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```sh
[14:00:00.000] INFO (20744): hello world
    some: "attributes"
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### `WinstonLogWriter`

Use the [Node.js `winston` logger library](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for writing Hive Logger's logs.

`winston` is an optional peer dependency, so you must install it first.

```sh
npm i winston
```

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';
import { WinstonLogWriter } from '@graphql-hive/logger/writers/winston';
import winston from 'winston';

const winstonLogger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()],
});

const log = new Logger({ writers: [new WinstonLogWriter(winstonLogger)] });

log.info({ some: 'attributes' }, 'hello world');
```

```sh
{"level":"info","message":"hello world","some":"attributes"}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Winston logger does not have a "trace" log level. Hive Logger will instead use "verbose" when writing logs to Winston.

### Custom Writers

You can implement custom log writers for the Hive Logger by creating a class that implements the `LogWriter` interface. This interface requires a single `write` method, which receives the log level, attributes, and message.

Your writer can perform any action, such as sending logs to a file, external service, or custom destination.

Writers can be synchronous (returning `void`) or asynchronous (returning a `Promise<void>`). If your writer performs asynchronous operations (like network requests or file writes), simply return a promise from the `write` method.

```ts
import {
  Attributes,
  ConsoleLogWriter,
  Logger,
  LogLevel,
  LogWriter,
} from '@graphql-hive/logger';

class HTTPLogWriter implements LogWriter {
  async write(level: LogLevel, attrs: Attributes, msg: string) {
    await fetch('https://my-log-service.com', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ level, attrs, msg }),
    });
  }
}

const log = new Logger({
  // send logs both to the HTTP loggging service and output them to the console
  writers: [new HTTPLogWriter(), new ConsoleLogWriter()],
});

log.info('Hello World!');

await log.flush(); // make sure all async writes settle
```

#### Flushing and Non-Blocking Logging

The logger does not block when you log asynchronously. Instead, it tracks all pending async writes internally. When you call `log.flush()` it waits for all pending writes to finish, ensuring no logs are lost on shutdown. During normal operation, logging remains fast and non-blocking, even if some writers are async.

This design allows you to use async writers without impacting the performance of your application or blocking the main thread.

##### Explicit Resource Management

The Hive Logger also supports [Explicit Resource Management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management). This allows you to ensure that all pending asynchronous log writes are properly flushed before your application exits or when the logger is no longer needed.

You can use the logger with `await using` (in environments that support it) to wait for all log operations to complete. This is especially useful in serverless or short-lived environments where you want to guarantee that no logs are lost due to unfinished asynchronous operations.

```ts
import {
  Attributes,
  ConsoleLogWriter,
  Logger,
  LogLevel,
  LogWriter,
} from '@graphql-hive/logger';

class HTTPLogWriter implements LogWriter {
  async write(level: LogLevel, attrs: Attributes, msg: string) {
    await fetch('https://my-log-service.com', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ level, attrs, msg }),
    });
  }
}

{
  await using log = new Logger({
    // send logs both to the HTTP loggging service and output them to the console
    writers: [new HTTPLogWriter(), new ConsoleLogWriter()],
  });

  log.info('Hello World!');
}

// logger went out of scope and all of the logs have been flushed
```

##### Handling Async Write Errors

The Logger handles write errors for asynchronous writers by tracking all write promises. When `await log.flush()` is called (including during async disposal), it waits for all pending writes to settle. If any writes fail (i.e., their promises reject), their errors are collected and after all writes have settled, if there were any errors, an `AggregateError` is thrown containing all the individual write errors.

```ts
import { Logger } from './Logger';

let i = 0;
const log = new Logger({
  writers: [
    {
      async write() {
        i++;
        throw new Error('Write failed! #' + i);
      },
    },
  ],
});

// no fail during logs
log.info('hello');
log.info('world');

try {
  await log.flush();
} catch (e) {
  // flush will fail with each individually failed writes
  console.error(e);
}
```

Outputs:

```sh
AggregateError: Failed to flush 2 writes
    at async <anonymous> (/project/example.js:20:3) {
  [errors]: [
    Error: Write failed! #1
        at Object.write (/project/example.js:9:15),
    Error: Write failed! #2
        at Object.write (/project/example.js:9:15)
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Serialization of Attributes

Hive Logger uses advanced serialization to ensure that all attributes are logged safely and readably, even when they contain complex or circular data structures. This means you can log rich, nested objects or errors as attributes without worrying about serialization failures or unreadable logs.

For example, the logger will serialize the error object, including its message and stack, in a safe and readable way. This advanced serialization is applied automatically to all attributes passed to log methods, child loggers, and writers.

```ts
import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

const log = new Logger();

class DatabaseError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'DatabaseError';
  }
}
const dbErr = new DatabaseError('Connection failed');
const userErr = new Error('Updating user failed', { cause: dbErr });
const errs = new AggregateError([dbErr, userErr], 'Failed to update user');

log.error(errs);
```
